# 🚀 DataSON Performance Optimization PRD

## 📋 Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive profiling analysis, DataSON shows critical performance bottlenecks that require immediate investigation. While core serialization is fast (~89ms), security validation (`limits_prepare`) is causing **25+ second delays** - a 280x performance penalty that makes the library unusable for production workloads.

## 🔍 Profiling Findings

### Performance Baseline (Python-only, 1k data)
| Stage | Median Time | P95 Time | Status |
|-------|-------------|----------|---------|
| `serialize_inner_python` | 89ms | 3,526ms | ✅ Acceptable |
| `eligibility_check` | 291ms | 1,815ms | ⚠️ Could optimize |
| `limits_prepare` | **25,417ms** | **47,508ms** | 🚨 Critical issue |
| `save_string` | 59ms | 35,241ms | ⚠️ High variance |
| `load_basic_json` | 762ms | 6,841ms | ⚠️ Slow for 1k data |
| `smart_scalars` | 1.8ms | 35ms | ✅ Fast |
| `postprocess` | 68ms | 1,347ms | ✅ Acceptable |

### Throughput Analysis
- **Current**: ~2,870 ops/sec
- **Target with fixes**: 15,000+ ops/sec
- **Bottleneck**: Security validation blocking all operations

## 🎯 Investigation Priorities

### P0 - Critical (Immediate)
**1. `limits_prepare` Stage Investigation**
- **Current**: 25+ second delays
- **Expected**: <10ms for security checks
- **Investigate**:
  - `/datason/_security.py` or similar security modules
  - Circular imports or infinite loops
  - Regex performance in validation
  - File I/O operations in limits checking

**2. Performance Regression Analysis**
- **Action**: Compare with previous versions
- **Target**: Identify when this bottleneck was introduced
- **Files**: Git blame on security/limits related code

### P1 - High Priority
**3. `load_basic_json` Optimization**
- **Current**: 762ms for 1k JSON parsing
- **Expected**: <50ms for 1k data
- **Investigate**:
  - JSON parsing implementation in `/datason/api.py`
  - Smart scalar detection overhead
  - Type inference algorithms

**4. `eligibility_check` Performance**
- **Current**: 291ms
- **Expected**: <10ms
- **Investigate**:
  - Data type inspection logic
  - Complex object traversal
  - Recursive analysis depth

### P2 - Medium Priority
**5. Performance Variance Investigation**
- **Issue**: P95 times 10-100x higher than medians
- **Investigate**: Memory allocation patterns, GC pressure
- **Target**: Consistent sub-100ms performance

## 🔍 Code Areas to Investigate

### Primary Investigation Targets

**1. Security/Limits Module**
```python
# Likely locations:
datason/_security.py
datason/config.py (limit configurations)
datason/_profiling.py (limits_prepare stage)
```

**2. Core API Implementation**
```python
# Performance-critical paths:
datason/api.py (dumps_json, loads_json functions)
datason/__init__.py (save_string, load_basic)
```

**3. Type System and Validation**
```python
# Eligibility and type checking:
datason/_types.py
datason/_validation.py
datason/smart_scalars.py
```

### Investigation Methodology

**1. Code Path Analysis**
- Trace execution through profiled stages
- Identify exact functions called in each stage
- Look for nested loops, recursive calls, or blocking I/O

**2. Performance Benchmarking**
- Create isolated tests for each stage
- Use `cProfile` and `line_profiler` for detailed analysis
- Test with different data sizes (1k, 10k, 100k)

**3. Regression Testing**
- Test against previous DataSON versions
- Identify commit that introduced the bottleneck
- Compare against standard `json` library performance

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
| Stage | Current | Target | Improvement |
|-------|---------|--------|-------------|
| `limits_prepare` | 25,417ms | <10ms | **2,541x** |
| `load_basic_json` | 762ms | <50ms | **15x** |
| `eligibility_check` | 291ms | <10ms | **29x** |
| **Overall throughput** | 2,870 ops/sec | 15,000+ ops/sec | **5x** |

### Quality Metrics
- ✅ P95 latency within 3x of median
- ✅ Linear scaling with data size
